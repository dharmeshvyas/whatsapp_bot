# Disclaimer
i'm not affiliated or authorized by Meta/Facebook/WhatsApp. Use this at your own risk. I'm not responsible for failed/wrong send messages. Sometimes WhatsApp changes some xpath, so make sure to test every single time, before using this for an application, that mustn't fail. If there is an error, it's mostly some changed xpath, sometimes a geckodriver update is required.
